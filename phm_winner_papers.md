I. Recurrent Neural Networks for Online Remaining Useful Life Estimation in Ion Mill Etching System
1. Reduce number data by extract 10 in 24 fields data
2. Model training by deep learning LSTM networks

II. Concurrent Estimation of Remaining Useful Life for Multiple Faults in an Ion Etch Mill: A Data-driven Approach
1. Reduce number data by extract 13 in 24 fields data
2. Model trained Random forest has highest accuracy and lowest mean square error

III. Remaining Useful Life Estimation for Systems with Abrupt Failures
1. Random forest classifier to identity the system operation mode normal or degrading
2. Model training by deep learning LSTM networks

These are overview about 3 papers. I think to approach the good result 3 way has same complexity.
